    .large-12.column
      p Over the years Red Hat and JBoss have received many awards for our products, projects, teams and individuals. These have included the Duke’s Choice Award for Netty because of the project’s performance, reliability and ease of use, and Gavin King who became a Java Champion for his contributions to the Java Community. We’re always grateful to receive these awards on behalf of Red Hat and our communities; we strive to ensure that we’re living up to the ideals that resulted in them being awarded on a daily basis. In these pages we list some of the awards that we have received in various categories. We thank everyone who is involved in the nominations and voting processes for these and future awards, irrespective of whether or not we eventually win.

          h3 Red Hat JBoss Middleware - No. 1 for Customer Satisfaction - 2011
      .large-12.columns
        p Every year we commission independent research firm Velociti Partners to initiate a survey comparing Red Hat customer service with some of our key competitors; and every year we are excited about the results. And 2011 is no exception as we’re pleased to announce that, for the fifth year in a row, Red Hat customers ranked Red Hat JBoss Middleware No. 1 for customer satisfaction. Red Hat’s consistently high customer satisfaction rankings are largely due to the company’s focus on the customer. This focus is derived from Red Hat's ability to provide customers with the solutions they need to achieve their business goals more quickly, as well as award-winning support during a project’s lifecycle, from initial development to mission-critical, 24x7 production issues.

        p The Great Java Application Server Debate is a specialized Survey run by ZeroTurnaround and reflected the overall developer view on Java EE application servers. JBoss WildFly is the only application server in the group whose score never dropped below a 4, and interestingly the received the joint fewest top marks of 5 in the categories. JBoss WildFly consistently performs very well in each category which is why it also shines in the developer profiles exercise.
