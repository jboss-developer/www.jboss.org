== Detail

=== Native Mobile Push
The UnifiedPush Server is at the core of JBoss Mobile Add-On.
With a single request to the UnifiedPush Server, your server-side application can send push notification requests to both Apple Push Notification Service for iOS devices and Google Cloud Messaging for Android devices.

The UnifiedPush Server acts as push notification middleware, routing push notification requests from your server-side applications to the appropriate mobile-specific notification centers.

Through the modern and simple UnifiedPush Server Console, you can register and manage the push services of all of your Android, iOS and Cordova push applications, streamlining push application management.


=== Tooling from JBDS
Apache Cordova-optimized tooling, letting you visually model your HTML5-based UI in either jQuery Mobile or AngularJS + Ionic and mobile hybrid simulator for interactive testing of your application.
