### Getting Started
The best way to discover a new product is to get hands-on with the product.
We have put together an online http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/workshops.html#/[JBoss BPM Suite workshop], where you are introduced to the product in an overview presentation before embarking on installing and building the project.
You will be building an HR employee rewards process project that includes human tasks, domain specific nodes, and a process, all within the latest JBoss BPM Suite product.
The http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/workshops.html#/5[Red Hat JBoss BPM Suite - HR Employee Rewards Demo] is laid out with links and video to all the available material for exploring this project.

### Installation Instructions
The simplest and quickest way to get started with JBoss BPM Suite, is to run it in the Cloud on OpenShift.
See the next section for details.
However, if you would like to install it yourself, follow these instructions:

1. JBoss BPM Suite from 6.1 release onwards does not bundle EAP inside its installer. Visit the link:#{site.base_url}/products/eap/download/[EAP downloads page] to download and then install EAP version 6.4 before using the JBoss BPM Suite installer.
2. Visit the link:#{site.base_url}/products/bpmsuite/download[JBoss BPM Suite download page] and download the installer.
3. Make sure you have a JDK of your choice installed. We recommend OpenJDK or Oracle JDK.
4. You can now (optionally) install the Integration Stack for JBoss Developer Studio. This provides IDE support for developing JBoss BPM Suite applications. For more details, see the link:/products/devstudio/get-started/#ExtraSection[installation instructions].
