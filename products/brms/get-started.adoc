### Getting Started
The best way to discover a new product is to get hands-on with the product.
We have put together an online http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/workshops.html#/[JBoss BRMS workshop], where you are introduced to the product in an overview presentation before embarking on installing and building the project.
You will be http://bpmworkshop-onthe.rhcloud.com/workshops.html#/4[building a retail webshop project] that includes rules, events, and ruleflow, all within the latest link:../overview[JBoss BRMS product].

The https://github.com/eschabell/brms-coolstore-demo[Red Hat JBoss BRMS - Retail Rules & Events with the Cool Store Demo] is laid out with links and video to all the available material for exploring this project.

### Installation Instructions
The simplest and quickest way to get started with JBoss BRMS, is to run it in the Cloud on OpenShift.
See the next section for details.
However, if you would like to install it yourself, follow these instructions:

1. JBoss BRMS from 6.1 release onwards does not bundle EAP inside its installer. Visit the link:#{site.base_url}/products/eap/download/[EAP downloads page] to download and then install EAP version 6.4 before using the JBoss BRMS installer.
2. Visit the link:#{site.base_url}/products/brms/download/[JBoss BRMS download page] and download the installer.
3. Make sure you have a JDK of your choice installed. We recommend OpenJDK or Oracle JDK.
4. You can now (optionally) install the Integration Stack for JBoss Developer Studio. This provides IDE support for developing JBoss BRMS applications. For more details, see the installation instructions.
