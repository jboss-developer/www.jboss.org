        We get it. What you get from our open source projects is pretty great. And frankly, this stuff
        doesn't cost you a dime. So, why should you even consider paying or, even worse, asking someone
        with the budget to pay for JBoss Enterprise Middleware?
    p Well, it's pretty simple, and there is real value to developers from our enterprise subscriptions.

          It's the same stuff you were using before, but "Enterprized". Red Hat give you the same "bits", rather
          than providing a cut-down free version. The icing on the cake is the extensive quality engineering,
          testing and security auditing that we perform on all Red Hat Enterprise products. We fully test and
          certify over 20 different operating system and JVM combinations, and 13 databases. All of these
          certifications last for the full lifecycle of the product release. These facts should keep your ops
          team happy!
