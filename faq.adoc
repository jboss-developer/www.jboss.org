== Overview

=== What is the JBoss Developer Program?

The purpose of the Red Hat JBoss Developer program is to provide subscribers the best tools, content and assistance so that they can be as productive as possible with Red Hat JBoss middleware technologies.

Subscribers get access to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Middleware products, exclusive content and access to product-focused forums.  All of these assets are focused on helping subscribers make applications with JBoss technologies as easy as possible.

=== How do I get a subscription?

You must have an account in order to download product binaries under the $0 developer subscription, post in the forums, and access exclusive content. In order to register for an account you will need to provide your name and your email address. We encourage you to provide more information so that others know a bit more about you.  You must also agree to the http://www.jboss.org/developer-program/termsandconditions[terms and conditions] of the program.

1. Click the *Register* link at the top right of this page.
2. Fill out the form.
3. You will be sent an email to verify your email address.

=== Will a subscription cost me anything?

The JBoss Developer Program is available for $0.  You will need to register, provide some minimal information and agree to the http://www.jboss.org/developer-program/termsandconditions[terms and conditions] of the program.

=== Are there any restrictions?

The http://www.jboss.org/developer-program/termsandconditions[terms and conditions] describe how the developer program subscription may be used.  The major difference between a full commercial http://www.redhat.com/about/subscription/[Red Hat subscription] and the Developer Program subscription is that the Red Hat JBoss Developer Program is intended for individual *developer-use* only.  Integration, test and production environments will require a paid subscription.

== Asking for help

=== How do I ask for help?

Many pages include a comment box at the bottom. This allows you to quickly ask a question about the topic covered by the page.

Alternatively, you may want to post a message in a link:../forums[forum]. Each forum contains a series of related topics, allowing users to search for information quickly and easily. Creating a new thread is as simple as choosing a relevant forum and posting a message. Threads are stored in chronological order so that anyone reading them later can follow what was discussed.Replies to threads are nested.

=== When should I create a new thread?

If you're thinking about using the forums to ask for help, or to find the answer to a question, then take a moment to have a look and see if somebody else has already created a similar thread or posted a reply with relevant information. This may well save you time!

If you cannot find a previous thread, then should create a new thread.

=== Is there a guide to using the search, markup wiki and other features of community.jboss.org?

http://community.jboss.org uses Jive. You can find the user guide for Jive link:http://docs.jivesoftware.com/jive/6.0/community_user/index.jsp[here^].

== Reporting issues with JBoss Products and Upstream Projects

=== How do I report an issue?

Our issue tracking system is available on http://issues.jboss.org. You may use your jboss.org user account to login this system. To find out how to use the issue tracking system, refer to https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/JIRA+Documentation

=== What information should I provide when submitting a bug report?

When submitting a bug report, please include the following information:

* The operating system you are using, e.g. RHEL 5, Windows XP, Solaris 10
* The JDK or JRE you are using, e.g. Sun Microsystems JDK 1.5.0_09
* As much of the stack trace (if there is one) as necessary to show the cause of the problem.
* A list of steps needed to reproduce the bug.

The objective is to give enough information for someone with no prior knowledge of the bug to recreate the problem for themselves. Too little information may prevent them understanding when the bug occurs and too much information can create unnecessary confusion.

=== What information should I provide when submitting a Feature Request?

When submitting a request for a new feature make sure to keep it as clear and to the point as possible. Each new feature requires its own issue in the issue tracking system so that they can be addressed separately by developers. It is up to the project leads to determine when new features are added, according to the development plans they have made. You may point out reasons why features should be added sooner rather than later, such as the ability to compete with an alternative technology, but unless you are willing to do the work yourself you may have to wait for development to take place.

It is very helpful to provide any use cases you may have, to help the person who implements your request understand the motivation.
